# Common Recursive Algorithms

- **Subsets**: A recursive algorithm that generates all possible subsets of a given set of elements. This can be done by including or excluding each element in the set.

- **Permutations**: A recursive algorithm that generates all possible arrangements of a set of elements. This can be done by swapping elements in the set and generating permutations of the remaining elements.

- **Combinations**: A recursive algorithm that generates all possible combinations of a set of elements of a given size. This can be done by choosing a fixed number of elements from the set and generating combinations of the remaining elements.

- **Subsequences**: A recursive algorithm that generates all possible subsequences of a given sequence. This can be done by including or excluding each element in the sequence.

- **Subarray**: A subarray is a contiguous (adjacent and uninterrupted) portion of an array, which means it is a subset of elements that are located consecutively in the original array. For example, if we have an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then [2, 3, 4] is a subarray of it, but [1, 3, 5] is not a subarray because the elements are not adjacent in the original array.

- **Parenthesis** combinations: A recursive algorithm that generates all possible combinations of opening and closing parentheses of a given length. This can be done by recursively adding opening or closing parentheses until the desired length is reached.

- **String** permutations: A recursive algorithm that generates all possible permutations of the characters in a given string. This can be done by swapping characters in the string and generating permutations of the remaining characters.

- **Graph** traversals: A recursive algorithm that explores all possible paths in a graph. This can be done by recursively visiting adjacent nodes and generating paths from the visited nodes.
