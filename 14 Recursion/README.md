# Common Recursive Algorithms

- **Subsets**: A recursive algorithm that generates all possible subsets of a given set of elements. This can be done by including or excluding each element in the set.

- **Permutations**: A recursive algorithm that generates all possible arrangements of a set of elements. This can be done by swapping elements in the set and generating permutations of the remaining elements.

- **Combinations**: A recursive algorithm that generates all possible combinations of a set of elements of a given size. This can be done by choosing a fixed number of elements from the set and generating combinations of the remaining elements.

- **Subsequences**: A recursive algorithm that generates all possible subsequences of a given sequence. This can be done by including or excluding each element in the sequence.

- **Parenthesis** combinations: A recursive algorithm that generates all possible combinations of opening and closing parentheses of a given length. This can be done by recursively adding opening or closing parentheses until the desired length is reached.

- **String** permutations: A recursive algorithm that generates all possible permutations of the characters in a given string. This can be done by swapping characters in the string and generating permutations of the remaining characters.

- **Graph** traversals: A recursive algorithm that explores all possible paths in a graph. This can be done by recursively visiting adjacent nodes and generating paths from the visited nodes.
