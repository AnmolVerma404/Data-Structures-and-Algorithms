/*
Before going to MST what is spanning tree
- All vertics are connected to other vertices in graph
- Therefor a cycle is possible
*/
/*
A graph is called minimum spanning tree iff:-
                                            - All are connected and no cycle is avalible
                                            - The connected path is minimized
