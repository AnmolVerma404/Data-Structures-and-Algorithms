/*
Before going to MST what is spanning tree
- All vertics are connected to other vertices in graph
- Therefor a cycle is possible in the graph but for spanning tree a cycle can't be in the path
*/
/*
A graph is called minimum spanning tree iff:-
                                            - All are connected and no cycle is avalible
                                            - The connected path is minimized
                                            - For non connected graph we can't find spanning tree
