/*
What is Graph Data Structure?
It is a nonlinear data structure to store inter-related or connected data.
It consists of edges and vertices.

Vertices - A node where data and information about connected nodes are stored
Edges - It defines the connection b/w two nodes

Graphs are further characterized into two types - Directed and Undirected Graph
Undirected Graph - This type of graph has two edges b/w every connected vertex, traversal from both vertex to the other vertex is possible.
Directed Graph - In this type of Graph there are at most two edges b/w every connected vertex. Traversal from node a to node b may be possible but visa versa might not be possible.

InDegree of a graph - The number of edges directed towards the node.
OutDegree of a graph - The number of vertices the node is pointing towards

Cycle in a Graph - In a traversal of a graph if starting node is once again visited then we can assume it's a cyclic graph Eg - a->b->c->a is a cyclic graph.
Acyclic graph - A graph that does not contain a cycle. Most of the Directed graphs are Acyclic

TIP - Just deeply understand BFS and DFS traversal in Graph
