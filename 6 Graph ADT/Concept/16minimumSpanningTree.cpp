/*
Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) - 
MST is tree build from graph of N vertex which have excatly N vertices and N-1 Edges and it should follow all the properties of a tree i.e. a child node should not have edge between them and their ancestors. And a node must have only one parent. Root node have no parent.
There are two algorith to find the MST - 
    - Prims Algorithm
    - Kruskals Algorithm
